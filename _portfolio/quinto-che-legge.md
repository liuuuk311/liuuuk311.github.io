*Warning: This is project is not public available anymore.* 

I designed and developed a static website using HTML5 and CSS3 for an NGO where I used to volunteer. Unfortunately, the NGO doesn't exist anymore, and the site is not available. 

No specification was given for this project.  I came up with a clean and intuitive design because the target users often are not tech-savvy.

Here I share some screenshot of the website:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/quinto_che_legge/Screenshot_1.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="The home page with a slide show." %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/quinto_che_legge/Screenshot_2.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="The about page." %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/quinto_che_legge/Screenshot_3.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="The conctact us page." %}
