*Warning: This is project is not public available anymore.* 

I designed and developed a static website using HTML5 and CSS3 for an NGO where I used to volunteer. Unfortunately, the NGO doesn't exist anymore, and the site is not available. 

No specification was given for this project.  I came up with a clean and intuitive design because the target users often are not tech-savvy.

Here I share some screenshot of the website:
