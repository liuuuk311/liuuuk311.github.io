As my last exam in my Master Degree in Computer Science, I had a Software Engineering project. For this reason, I teamed up with Marco, and together, we built a system that enables users, through an iOS app, to search, book and review private chefs. 

The exam was a bit complex. We had to write the system requirements document, so, since we were also the stakeholders,  we had to explain what we were going to build.
Then, we designed all the architecture of the system. We used common diagrams like sequence diagrams, use cases, class diagram, and so on. 
Next, we developed the system. We divided our tasks; Marco was in charge of the iOS application while I implemented the backend.

For the backend, I used Node.js and Express. The database I chose was MongoDB. 

Finally, we had to test the system. We made some unit test, and also some integration testing. 

The project is fully available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mrcsilverfox/chefexperience).
