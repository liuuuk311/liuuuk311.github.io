[Radio Bicocca](http://www.radiobicocca.it/) it's the Web Radio of my University. You could listen to the radio just on their website, this motivated me to build an Android App that lets you listen to the University's radio. 

Back then I was also interested to learn how to develop Android apps. So, I started with a Google sample app, reading the code and try to figure out how the code worked.

I spent my spare time for a couple month developing this app. When I got a working demo, I contacted a friend who was working at Radio Bicocca to get some feedback. With his feedback, I spent about three weeks to improve the app and then I came back with a new verision with a better UI.
