I live in Milan, Italy and I study Computer Science at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

Since when I was young I wanted to understand how things work. This brought me to study Computer Science because I wanted to understand how computers and the internet worked.

There's always something new to learn. I'm currently learning more about Data Science and Machine Learning.
