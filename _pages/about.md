I'm a professional Data Integration Consultant and a responsible freelancer.
I recently graduated in Computer Science, where I learned different subjects, such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and of course programming in general. 

Coding has always been my passion, so I'm thrilled to help you out with your project. 

During my career, I worked on several projects. If you want to know more about my past projects, visit my portfolio page. 
Please feel free to contact me or visit my LinkedIn profile, if you would like to have more info. 

I'm always ready for new challenging projects, and I'm prepared to learn new things.

Here's a partial list of programming languages I know:
* Python
* JavaScript (jQuery, Node.js)
* HTML5 & CSS3
* SQL
