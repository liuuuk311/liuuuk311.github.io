My name is Luca. I study Computer Science at Univeristy of Milano-Bicocca, in Milan, Italy.

Since when I was young I wanted to understand how things work. This brought me to study Computer Science because I wanted to understand how computers and internet work.

But there's always something new to learn. In fact, now I would like to learn more about data science.
